# LyndsayUI Dev Setup

Welcome to the inner sanctum of LyndsayUI.

This project uses bleeding-edge C++ tools and expects your system to show up ready to **compile like a beast**. If you're not there yet — we got you.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Linux (Arch or Fedora preferred)
- Git
- CMake (optionally latest)
- Ninja (or Make)
- GCC and/or Clang

## 🚀 Setup

Run this one-time setup script to install required tools:

```bash
chmod +x setup-dev.sh
./setup-dev.sh
```

What it does:
- Detects your distro
- Installs dev tools (`gcc`, `clang`, `cmake`, `ninja`, etc.)
- Optionally builds the latest CMake from source
- Drops it in `~/.local/bin` and updates your `PATH`

> **Note:** If you build CMake, restart your terminal or run:
> ```bash
> source ~/.bashrc
> ```

## 🔨 Building Lyndsay

Use the build script to create and compile the project:

```bash
chmod +x build-lyndsay.sh
./build-lyndsay.sh
```

What it does:
- Creates a clean `build/` folder
- Runs `cmake .. -G Ninja` inside it
- Builds the project
- Gives you ✨VIBES✨ on success (or sass on failure)

### 💡 Using `make` instead?

Edit `build-lyndsay.sh` and change this line:

```bash
cmake .. -G Ninja
```

to:

```bash
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
make
```

---

## 🧪 Running Your App

Once built, add something like this to the end of `build-lyndsay.sh`:

```bash
echo "[+] Running Lyndsay demo..."
./path/to/your/demo-binary
```

## ❤️ Script Provenance

These scripts include bits generated by ChatGPT — clearly marked. ASCII art included.  
You're encouraged to leave them in as a badge of ~chaotic energy~.

## 🔥 Pro Tips

- Want to use Clang or build in Debug mode? Edit the CMake line:
  ```bash
  cmake .. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
  ```
- Want `compile_commands.json` for clangd or IDEs?
  ```bash
  cmake .. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
  ```

## 🎉 That's it!

You’re now ready to build and wield Lyndsay like a digital sword.  
If it explodes — check your compiler.  
If it works — take the credit.

Now go make something cool.
